**Team Members**: Aaron Huang, Andy Ho, Cameron King, ChanChan Mao, Mathew Kramsch 

#### Description
Calorie Diary is a mobile application that helps track your daily calorie consumption. Itâ€™s designed to help users consistently track their calorie intake through a fun, gamified interface. In addition, Calorie Diary offers social media functionality such as a leaderboard to celebrate your dietary achievements with other people. This app also uses Firebase authentication and database to keep your data secure and accessible from different devices. 

#### Audience
This app is generally aimed at people who are looking to get started with working out and eating healthier or maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Since our application will allow for users to set a health goal of either gaining weight or losing weight, our target demographic includes both overweight and underweight users, as well as people who would just like to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle.

#### Problem to Solve
This app aims to retain the motivation that people have towards working out and eating healthy. People typically get motivated to start something, but they slowly lose the motivation to continue the process consistently on a daily basis. We hope that by gamifying and tying in social media aspects, people will be incentivised to consistently achieve their health and fitness goals. In addition, our application aims to solve the difficulty and hassle that people trying to stick to strict diets face. Our application will make the process of tracking daily caloric intake easier and more insightful, which will help users stick to their health goals.
